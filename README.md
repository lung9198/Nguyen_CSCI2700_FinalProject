# Nguyen_CSCI2700_FinalProject
Program was supposed to be a game altering assignment 8's Zombie graph.
Graph would be set up differently, more like a binary tree, but would have alternating "weights" between each node, greater the weight, more zombies to kill. Took too much  time trying to randomize the graph each play through, was not able to complete the game.

What I  have so far, is just the completed graph with no Game additions. User is able to pick and choose which outpost to travel to, while also being shown the number of Outpost  away from the HQ(finish point). 

User was supposed to have 4 variables ,  bullets, batteries, flares, and survivors, but those did not make it into program.
